#Flappybird Copyright by Tran Thanh Vinh, Student id: 20020503.

I apologize in advance, my code is quite convoluted.
If and when things go wrong, Google is your best bet.
Feel free to contact me at Vinitran124@gmail.com for any questions!

Introduce Game:
- Flappy Bird was a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics.
The objective was to direct a flying bird, named "Faby", who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. 
If the player touches the pipes, they lose.
- The original version of Flappy Bird was created by Ha Dong Nguyen and was removed from the app stores on 9.2.2014.

Requirements:
- Visual Studio or Code block

Rule:
- You must Click on the screen, or use your spacebar to get started. 
Fly the bird as far as you can without hitting a pipe.

Source code:
- I use the Simple DirectMedia Layer - SDL version 2.0.14.
You can download these libraries from https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php.
Also i use the random, string and time.h library.
